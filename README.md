- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AndrewDushenin
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in reading and chess.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Front-End development.

- &#9819; I have 5 years of experience in HR and sales. 
Unfortunately, I was too tired of working with staff, and decided to change the professional field to development.
I really love chess and reading. I am studying at the university as a coach.
